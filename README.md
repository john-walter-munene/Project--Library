# Project--Library

This project is a part of Odin's curicullum. It entails building a software for managing your books. A user can add, edit status, and delete books from their shelf. 

From the programming perspective, the project is a flex of JavaScript fundamentals. These include Objects, functions, classes, DOM manipulation, array methods, and event listeners.
